# Jacksum FBI for Windows

The Jacksum File Browser Integration for Microsoft Windows allows you to access features of [Jacksum](https://github.com/jonelo/jacksum) through [HashGarten](https://github.com/jonelo/HashGarten) from the Send To menu at the Microsoft File Explorer.

## Requirements

  * Microsoft Windows 10 or 11
  * At least one of the supported file browsers below
  * Hardware
    * Processor with x64 chip set
    * 128 MiB free RAM
    * 128 MiB free disk space
   
## Supported File Browsers

Any file manager that supports the Microsoft Windows Standard "Send To"-API is supported by this integration program. In addition to that, file managers are supported that support a way to pass files or directories to external scripts or programs - which allows them to access the Send To functions indirectly. The following file managers have been tested successfully.

Note: if your preferred file manager is not listed above, and it does not support "Send to", chances are high that your file manager supports at least drag & drop, so you could use drag & drop to transfer file/directory-paths from your file manager to the HashGarten GUI where you can process further, e. g. calculate hashes from those file/directory-paths.

## Download

Go to https://github.com/jonelo/jacksum-fbi-windows/releases/latest and download the .zip which contains a precompiled executable for Microsoft Windows.
You also find official hashes in the release notes.

## Installation

Just extract the .zip file and double-click on the executable called `Jacksum Windows Explorer Integration.exe`.
Allow Microsoft Defender SmartScreen to start the app. Before you do that you should verify hashes to make sure you have obtained the executable from a reliable source.

The installer installs the JDK 17, Jacksum, and HashGarten to the user's home directory under the folder "Jacksum Windows Explorer Integration". The environment variable called
JACKSUM_HOME is set with the value of the installation folder, and it is added to the user's PATH, so you also launch Jacksum just by typing `jacksum` if you want to.

You can launch the installer as often as you want.

After successful installation a dialog box informs you what have been done.

In the "Jacksum Windows Explorer integration" folder you also find an uninstaller.exe which removes
Jacksum entirely from your disk again.

## Use it

After a menu item has been selected, [HashGarten](https://github.com/jonelo/HashGarten) resp. [Jacksum](https://github.com/jonelo/jacksum) take over.

## Customization

You can modify the batch (just select item 4 at the Send To menu) if the default customized format does not meet your need or if you use a different editor rather than the Windows Notepad.

## Developer hints

The installer called sendto.nsi is written in NSIS. You need the NSIS compiler to compile .nsi, see also https://nsis.sourceforge.io.
