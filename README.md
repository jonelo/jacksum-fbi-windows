## Download

Go to https://github.com/jonelo/jacksum-fbi-windows/releases/latest and download the .zip which contains a precompiled executable for Microsoft Windows.
You also find official hashes in the release notes.

## Installation

Just extract the .zip file and double-click on the executable called `Jacksum Windows Explorer Integration.exe`.
Allow Microsoft Defender SmartScreen to start the app. Before you do that you should verify hashes to make sure you have obtained the executable from a reliable source.

The installer installs the JDK 17, Jacksum, and HashGarten to the user's home directory under the folder "Jacksum Windows Explorer Integration". The environment variable called
JACKSUM_HOME is set with the value of the installation folder, and it is added to the user's PATH, so you also launch Jacksum just by typing `jacksum` if you want to.

You can launch the installer as often as you want.

After successful installation a dialog box informs you what have been done.

In the "Jacksum Windows Explorer integration" folder you also find an uninstaller.exe which removes
Jacksum entirely from your disk again.

## Use it

After a menu item has been selected, [HashGarten](https://github.com/jonelo/HashGarten) resp. [Jacksum](https://github.com/jonelo/jacksum) take over.

## Customization

You can modify the batch (just select item 4 at the Send To menu) if the default customized format does not meet your need or if you use a different editor rather than the Windows Notepad.

## Developer hints

The installer called sendto.nsi is written in NSIS. You need the NSIS compiler to compile .nsi, see also https://nsis.sourceforge.io.
